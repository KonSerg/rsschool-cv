## About Me:

Started my IT career as a computer repairer in 2009. In parallel, I worked as a freelancer in web-development. I had to learn and work with different CMS. Finally, I learned wordpress on my own and worked with it for many years. 

Recently, my main profile is FullStack development on 1C-Bitrix CMS and Bitrix24. For some time I was the head of the tech department in small company for the integration of CRM Bitrix24. During that time, I realized that my strengths are: stress tolerance, crisis management, independence, mentoring, responsibility. 

Currently, the main goal is to study new technologies to improve professionalism in web development. Desire to work in a large IT company.
